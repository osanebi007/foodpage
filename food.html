        <h2 id="car">Carbohydrates</h2>
        <p>Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body. They are broken down into glucose, which fuels bodily functions.</p>
        <p>Foods rich in carbohydrates include rice, bread, pasta, and cereals. These are staples in many diets worldwide.</p>
        <p>Carbohydrates are classified into simple and complex types. Simple carbs are found in sugars, while complex carbs are in whole grains.</p>
        <p>Consuming adequate carbohydrates is essential for maintaining energy levels throughout the day.</p>
        <p>However, excessive intake of refined carbohydrates can lead to health issues like obesity and diabetes.</p>

        <h2 id="pro">Proteins</h2>
        <p>Proteins are essential for growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues. They are made up of amino acids.</p>
        <p>Sources of protein include meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, and plant-based options like beans and lentils.</p>
        <p>Proteins play a crucial role in building muscles, enzymes, and hormones in the body.</p>
        <p>A deficiency in protein can lead to conditions like muscle wasting and weakened immunity.</p>
        <p>It is important to consume a balanced amount of protein to support overall health and development.</p>

        <h2 id="fat">Fats</h2>
        <p>Fats are a concentrated source of energy and help in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).</p>
        <p>Healthy fats are found in foods like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, while unhealthy fats are in processed foods.</p>
        <p>Fats also provide insulation and protect vital organs in the body.</p>
        <p>Consuming too much saturated or trans fats can lead to heart disease and other health problems.</p>
        <p>Moderation is key when including fats in your diet to maintain a healthy balance.</p>

        <h2 id="vit">Vitamins</h2>
        <p>Vitamins are organic compounds that help regulate various bodily functions and boost the immune system.</p>
        <p>They are categorized into water-soluble (e.g., Vitamin C, B-complex) and fat-soluble (e.g., Vitamins A, D, E, K).</p>
        <p>Fruits, vegetables, and fortified foods are excellent sources of vitamins.</p>
        <p>Each vitamin has a specific role, such as Vitamin C for immunity and Vitamin D for bone health.</p>
        <p>A deficiency in vitamins can lead to health issues like scurvy, rickets, or weakened immunity.</p>
